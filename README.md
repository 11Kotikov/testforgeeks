# What is this about?
Hello my dear *user*, I present to you really **helpful** programme
which make your own <span style="color:green"> ARRAY[ ] </span>!!! 
### But it's more than that!!!
The greater thing is that doesn't matter how hard your try to input more than 3 symbols into it, IT USELESS!!! ha-ha-ha! Really <mark>MASSIVE</mark> right?
>## So...What you should do:
1. Open the *terminal*
2. Input <span style="color:yellow">*dotnet </span> run*
3. Input integer and positive quantity of elements inside your own array
4. Input whatever you want to fill each element
5. **LOOK UP! IT'S YOUR ARRAY** (but only if you typed 3-symbols or less at least at one possition, else, if it's not, you'll see a void array looks like this -> [ ] )

>Examples:

### 1. you typed array from 4 elements

|[ Russia|Denmark|Kazahstan|THEUSA ]|
|----------|-----------|---------|------------|

<sub>you will| see only| -> **[ ]**</sub>

### 2. you typed array from 3 elements

|[ Hello|2|:-) ]|
|----------|-----------|---------|

<sub>* and you |will see ->| **[ 2 :-) ]** </sub>
